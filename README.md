# refactor
Assignment on CSS
This assigment is intended as practice on the use of CSS
I modify backgorun color to the header and the sections to improve accessibility.
I also modify boxes to include rounded corners to make the webpage more appealing.
My teory is that brigh colors and atractive shapes are easier to catch at first sight.
